      <p>
        Hi! My name is Tomislav Geušić and I live in Samobor, small city near
        Zagreb. I started my front-end journey in november 2023. I still see
        myself as a beginner who have a lot of skills to learn. Before I starded
        my journey I worked as a CNC operator for 11 years. In my free time I
        like to play some video games and watch motorsports
